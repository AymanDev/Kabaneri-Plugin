# Kabaneri Plugin

This is my prototype for test availability to create such gameplay which
will looks like in Koutetsujou no Kabaneri

## Features
* Weapon (DIAMOND_SWORD right now). Shoots on right click  with custom damage, particle and sound effects
* When damaging entity added custom particle and sound effects
* Custom zombies. Right now they all only have custom display names

## Plans
* Infestation
* Spells(abilities)
* Custom items
* More interesting weapons
* Better custom zombies
* NPCs
* *more...*

## Dependencies
* [Holographic Display](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/holographic-displays)
* [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) - required for Holograms, 
but in future will be useful for plugin
